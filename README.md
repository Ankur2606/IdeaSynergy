## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ or Bun
- IBM Cloud account with API key for Granite API

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
bun install
```

3. Create `.env` file in the root directory and add your IBM Cloud API key:

```
# Server configuration
PORT=3001

# IBM Cloud API credentials
IBM_API_KEY=your_ibm_api_key_here

# WebSocket URL for frontend to connect to
VITE_WEBSOCKET_URL=ws://localhost:3001/ws
```

### Running the Application

#### Development Mode

Start the frontend development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
bun run dev
```

Start the backend server in a separate terminal:

```bash
npm run dev:server
# For building dist utils
npm run build
# or
bun run build
bun run dev:server
```

#### Production Mode

Build the application:

```bash
npm run build
# or
bun run build
```

Start the server:

```bash
npm run server
# or
bun run server
